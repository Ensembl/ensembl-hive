=head1 NAME

   Bio::EnsEMBL::Hive::Examples::Kmer::RunnableDB::CountKmers

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    Please refer to Bio::EnsEMBL::Hive::Examples::Kmer::PipeConfig::Kmer_conf pipeline configuration file
    to understand how this particular example pipeline is configured and ran.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

    'Bio::EnsEMBL::Hive::Examples::Kmer::RunnableDB::CountKmers is a runnable that counts the number of k-mers in a DNA sequence.

    As input, it takes the name of a file with a DNA sequence,
    the format of that file (which must be supported by Bio::SeqIO), 
    k (in bases),

    k must be >= 1.

    It flows out each k-mer seen, and the count of the k-mer in the (sub)sequence as key-value pairs.
    The key is the k-mer, and the value being the count.

=head2 fetch_input

    Description : Implements fetch_input() interface method of Bio::EnsEMBL::Hive::Process that is used to read in parameters and load data.
    There are no hard and fast rules on whether to fetch parameters in fetch_input(), or to wait until run() to fetch them.
    In general, fetch_input() is a place to validate parameter existence and values for errors before the worker get set into RUN state
    from the FETCH_INPUT state. In this case, since it's a simple computation, we don't do anything in fetch_input() and instead just
    handle the parameters in run()

=head2 run

    Description : Implements run() interface method of Bio::EnsEMBL::Hive::Process that is used to perform the main bulk of the job (minus input and output).

    Here, run() reads in the filename of a file containing a DNA sequence, 
    the format of that file (e.g. 'FASTA' - the format must be supported by Bio::SeqIO),
    and k,


    param('sequence_file'):      Name of the file containing the sequence
    param('input_format'):       Format of the sequence file (e.g. FASTA)
    param('k'):                  k

  if ( $sequence_file =~ /\.(?:gz|Z)$/) {
    open(my $in_fh, '-|', "gunzip -c $sequence_file");
    $input_seqio = Bio::SeqIO->new(-fh => $in_fh, -format => $self->param_required('input_format'));
    $self->param('input_fh', $in_fh); # storing as a param so that it can be closed by post_cleanup if necessary 
  } else {
    $input_seqio = Bio::SeqIO->new(-file => $sequence_file);
  }
  die "Could not open or parse '$sequence_file', please investigate" unless $input_seqio;

  my $kmer_counts = _count_kmers($input_seqio, $k);
  $self->param('kmer_counts', $kmer_counts);

}

=head2 write_output

    Description: Implements the write_output() interface method of Bio::EnsEMBL::Hive::Process that is used to flow output to the rest of the pipeline.

    This is where we dataflow the kmer counts out to the rest of the pipeline. We do this in three different ways on three
    different branches. Later on, we can choose a runnable to work with the counts we've generated here -- we choose
    one of the branches to match the output format here to the input format that runnable expects.

=cut

sub write_output {
  my $self = shift @_;

  my $kmer_counts = $self->param('kmer_counts');

  # Output the entire hash of kmer counts to an accu called kmer_counts_for_file, on flow 3
  $self->dataflow_output_id( {'counts' => $kmer_counts},
  			     3);

  # Output each kmer and count, tagged with the name of the sequence file it was counted in,
  # as a separate event, on flow 4
  foreach my $kmer(keys(%{$kmer_counts})) {
    $self->dataflow_output_id( {'kmer_with_source' => $self->param('sequence_file') . ":" . $kmer,
				'count' => $kmer_counts->{$kmer}
			       }, 4);
  }
  
  # Output each kmer on it's own, along with its count, as a separate event on flow 5
  foreach my $kmer(keys(%{$kmer_counts})) {
    $self->dataflow_output_id( {'kmer' => $kmer,
				'count' => $kmer_counts->{$kmer}
			       }, 5);
  }
}

=head2 _count_kmers

    Description: Private method to identify and count k-mers in a sequence.

    Arg [1] : A Bio::SeqIO input filehandle.
    Arg [2] : k

    Return  : A hashref of k-mer counts. key = k-mer, value = count
