=head1 NAME

    Bio::EnsEMBL::Hive::Examples::GC::RunnableDB::CountATGC

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    Please refer to Bio::EnsEMBL::Hive::PipeConfig::GCPct_conf pipeline configuration file
    to see how this runnable fits into the %GC example pipeline.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

    'Bio::EnsEMBL::Hive::Examples::GC::RunnableDB::CountATGC' counts the occurrences of A/T and G/C bases in
    the sequences in a .fasta file. It takes a .fasta file with DNA sequences as input. It flows out two parameters:
    at_count and gc_count.

=head2 param_defaults

    Description : Implements param_defaults() interface method of Bio::EnsEMBL::Hive::Process that defines module defaults for parameters.

sub param_defaults {

    return {
        'take_time' => 0,   # how much time run() method will spend in sleeping state
    };
}


=head2 fetch_input

    Description : Implements fetch_input() interface method of Bio::EnsEMBL::Hive::Process that is used to read in parameters and load data.
                  There are no hard and fast rules on whether to fetch parameters in fetch_input(), or to wait until run() to fetch them.
                  In general, fetch_input() is a place to validate parameter existence and values for errors before the worker get set into RUN state 
                  from the FETCH_INPUT state.

                  In this case, we decide to try and open our input file in fetch_input(), so that it will fail early if there is a problem with the
                  file open operation.

=cut

sub fetch_input {
  my $self = shift @_;

    my $chunkfile = $self->param_required('chunk_name');
    my $chunk_in = Bio::SeqIO->new(-file => "$chunkfile");
    $self->param('chunk_in', $chunk_in);

}

=head2 run

    Description : Implements run() interface method of Bio::EnsEMBL::Hive::Process that is used to perform the main bulk of the job.
                  Here, we use the file opened in fetch_input, read in the sequences from the file, and tally up the number of 
                  AT and GC bases seen. We then store these in parameters named at_count and gc_count.

=cut

sub run { 
    my $self = shift @_;

    my $at_count = 0;
    my $gc_count = 0;
    foreach my $chunkseq ($self->param('chunk_in')->next_seq()) {
      my $seqstring = $chunkseq->seq();
      $at_count += @{[$seqstring =~ /([AaTt])/g]};
      $gc_count += @{[$seqstring =~ /([GgCc])/g]};
    }

    $self->param('at_count', $at_count);
    $self->param('gc_count', $gc_count);

    sleep( $self->param('take_time') );
}

=head2 write_output

    Description : Implements write_output() interface method of Bio::EnsEMBL::Hive::Process that is used to deal with  the 
                  job's output after the execution.
                  The AT and GC counts dataflow down branch 1 in two parameters: 'at_count' and 'gc_count'.

=cut

sub write_output {  # but this time we have something to store
    my $self = shift @_;

    $self->dataflow_output_id( {
				'at_count' => $self->param('at_count'),
				'gc_count' => $self->param('gc_count'),
    }, 1);
}
