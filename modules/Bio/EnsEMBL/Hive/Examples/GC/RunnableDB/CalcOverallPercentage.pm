=head1 NAME

    Bio::EnsEMBL::Hive::Examples::GC::RunnableDB::CalcOverallPercentage

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    Please refer to Bio::EnsEMBL::Hive::PipeConfig::GCPct_conf pipeline configuration file
    to understand how this particular example pipeline is configured and run.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

    'Bio::EnsEMBL::Hive::Examples::GC::RunnableDB::CalcOverallPercentage' is the final step of the pipeline. 
    It sums up the GC and AT counts from all of the chunked subsequences, then divides the GC count by the GC + AT 
    count to determine %GC

=head2 param_defaults

    Description : Implements param_defaults() interface method of Bio::EnsEMBL::Hive::Process that defines module defaults for parameters.

=head2 fetch_input

    Description : Implements fetch_input() interface method of Bio::EnsEMBL::Hive::Process that is used to read in parameters and load data.

    There are no hard and fast rules on whether to fetch parameters in fetch_input(), or to wait until run() to fetch them.
    In general, fetch_input() is a place to validate parameter existence and values for errors before the worker get set into RUN state
    from the FETCH_INPUT state. In this case, since it's a simple computation, we don't do anything in fetch_input() and instead just
    handle the parameters in run()

=cut

sub fetch_input {   
    my $self = shift @_;
}

=head2 run

    Description : Implements run() interface method of Bio::EnsEMBL::Hive::Process that is used to perform the main bulk of the job.
                  Here, we fetch AT and GC counts, then call a subroutine to calculate %GC from the counts.

=cut

sub run { 
    my $self = shift @_;

    my $at_count = $self->param_required('at_count');
    my $gc_count = $self->param_required('gc_count');

    my $percentage = $self->_calc_pct($at_count, $gc_count);

    $self->param('result', $percentage);
    $self->warning("percentage is $percentage");
    
}

=head2 write_output

    Description : Implements write_output() interface method of Bio::EnsEMBL::Hive::Process that is used to deal with job's output after the execution.
                  Here, it flows the result from the %GC calculation out into branch 1 in a parameter called 'result'.

=cut


sub write_output {  # dataflow
    my $self = shift @_;

    $self->dataflow_output_id({
        'result'       => $self->param('result'),
    }, 1);
}

=head2 _calc_pct

    Description : This is a private method that does the actual %GC calculation.
                  $at_count is an arrayref pointing to a list of AT counts;
                  likewise, $gc_count is an arrayref pointint to a list of GC counts. In the
                  %GC pipeline, each element in the array is the count of AT or GC in one of the chunked
                  sequence files.

                  Here, we sum up the counts from all of the chunks, then divide the total GC count by the
                  total AT + GC count to determine a percentage.
                  
=cut

sub _calc_pct {
  my ($self, $at_count, $gc_count) = @_;

  # using reduce from List::Util
  my $at_sum = sum @{$at_count};
  my $gc_sum = sum @{$gc_count};

  my $pct_gc = 0;
  if (($at_sum + $gc_sum) != 0) {
    $pct_gc = $gc_sum / ($at_sum + $gc_sum);
  }
  return $pct_gc;
