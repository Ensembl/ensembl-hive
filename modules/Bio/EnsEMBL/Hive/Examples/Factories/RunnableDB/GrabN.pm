=head1 NAME

Bio::EnsEMBL::Hive::Examples::Factories::RunnableDB::GrabN

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    standaloneJob.pl Bio::EnsEMBL::Hive::Examples::Factories::RunnableDB::GrabN -input_id_list '[{"a"=>1},{"a"=>2}]' -debug 1

=head1 DESCRIPTION

    Runnable that takes a list of input_ids ("input_id_list"), removes some elements from it that are dataflown to branch #2
    whilst the remainder of the list is dataflown is dataflown to branch #1.  Several things can be parametrized: the number
    of elements taken from the list (on each end) and to which branch they are flown.
    The Runnable makes sense in the Bio::EnsEMBL::Hive::Examples::Factories::PipeConfig::FoldLeft_conf where we can recursively
    consume the list one element at a time and compute something along the way.

=head2 fetch_input

    Description : Implements fetch_input() interface method of Bio::EnsEMBL::Hive::Process that is used to read in parameters and load data.
                    This reads the list of hash "input_id_list" and extracts as many elements as requested (following the "grab_n_left" and
                    "grab_n_right" parameters) and push them to the "output_ids" array parameter. This represents the input_ids of the jobs
                    to be created.

    my $self = shift @_;

    my $input_id_list   = $self->param_required('input_id_list');
    my $grab_n_left     = $self->param_required('grab_n_left');

    die "Negative values are not allowed for 'grab_n_left'\n" if $grab_n_left < 0;

}


=head2 write_output

    Description : Implements write_output() interface method of Bio::EnsEMBL::Hive::Process that is used to deal with job's output after the execution.
                    This flows all the elements (hashes) of "output_ids" to the branch refered by "fan_branch_code" (default #2)
                    It then flows to branch #1 the remainder of the list, and a "_list_exhausted" flag that tells whether the list is now empty or not.

    $self->dataflow_output_id({'_list_exhausted' => !scalar(@$input_id_list), 'input_id_list' => $input_id_list}, 1);
