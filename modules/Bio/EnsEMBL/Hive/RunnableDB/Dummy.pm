=head1 NAME

    Bio::EnsEMBL::Hive::RunnableDB::Dummy

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    standaloneJob.pl Bio::EnsEMBL::Hive::RunnableDB::Dummy -input_id "{}"

    standaloneJob.pl Bio::EnsEMBL::Hive::RunnableDB::Dummy -input_id "{take_time=>3}"

    standaloneJob.pl Bio::EnsEMBL::Hive::RunnableDB::Dummy -input_id "{take_time=>'rand(3)+1'}"

=head1 DESCRIPTION

    A job of 'Bio::EnsEMBL::Hive::RunnableDB::Dummy' analysis does not do any work by itself,
    but it benefits from the side-effects that are associated with having an analysis.

    For example, if a dataflow rule is linked to the analysis then
    every job that is created or flown into this analysis will be dataflown further according to this rule.

    param('take_time'):     How much time to spend sleeping (floating point seconds);
                            can be given by a runtime-evaluated formula; useful for testing.

=head2 param_defaults

    Description : Implements param_defaults() interface method of Bio::EnsEMBL::Hive::Process that defines module defaults for parameters.

=cut

sub param_defaults {

    return {
        'take_time' => 0,   # how much time run() method will spend in sleeping state
    };
}


=head2 fetch_input

    Description : Implements fetch_input() interface method of Bio::EnsEMBL::Hive::Process that is used to read in parameters and load data.
                  Here we simply override this method so that nothing is done.

=cut

sub fetch_input {
}

=head2 run

    Description : Implements run() interface method of Bio::EnsEMBL::Hive::Process that is used to perform the main bulk of the job (minus input and output).
                  Since this Runnable is a Dummy, it does nothing. But it can also optionally sleep for param('take_time') seconds.

=cut

sub run {
    my $self = shift @_;

    my $take_time = eval $self->param('take_time');
    if($take_time) {
        print "Sleeping for '$take_time' seconds...\n";
        usleep( $take_time*1000000 );
        print "Done.\n";
    }
}

=head2 write_output

    Description : Implements write_output() interface method of Bio::EnsEMBL::Hive::Process that is used to deal with job's output after the execution.
                  Here we simply override this method so that nothing is done.

=cut

sub write_output {
