my $db      = Bio::EnsEMBL::DBAdaptor->new($locator);
my $repmask = Bio::EnsEMBL::Hive::RunnableDB::Dummy->new ( 
                                                    -db      => $db,
                                                    -input_id   => $input_id
                                                    -analysis   => $analysis );
$repmask->fetch_input(); #reads from DB

$repmask->write_output(); #writes to DB

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This object is used as a place holder in the hive system.
It does nothing, but is needed so that a Worker can grab
a job, pass the input through to output, and create the
next layer of jobs in the system.

=head2 batch_size
  Title   :   batch_size
  Usage   :   $value = $self->batch_size;
  Description: Defines the number of jobs the RunnableDB subclasses should run in batch
               before querying the database for the next job batch.  Used by the
               Hive system to manage the number of workers needed to complete a
               particular job type.

=head2 carrying_capacity
  Title   :   carrying_capacity
  Usage   :   $value = $self->carrying_capacity;
  Description: Defines the total number of Workers of this RunnableDB for a particular
               analysis_id that can be created in the hive.  Used by Queen to manage
               creation of Workers.
