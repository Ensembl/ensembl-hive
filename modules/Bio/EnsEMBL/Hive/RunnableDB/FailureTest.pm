=head1 NAME

    Bio::EnsEMBL::Hive::RunnableDB::FailureTest

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    This is a RunnableDB module that implements Bio::EnsEMBL::Hive::Process interface
    and is ran by Workers during the execution of eHive pipelines.
    It is not generally supposed to be instantiated and used outside of this framework.

    Please refer to Bio::EnsEMBL::Hive::Process documentation to understand the basics of the RunnableDB interface.

    Please refer to Bio::EnsEMBL::Hive::PipeConfig::* pipeline configuration files to understand how to configure pipelines.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

    This RunnableDB module is used to test failure of jobs in the hive system.

    It is intended for development/training purposes only.

    Available parameters:

        param('value'):         is essentially your job's number.
                                If you are intending to create 100 jobs, let the param('value') take consecutive values from 1 to 100.

        param('divisor'):       defines the failure rate for this particular analysis. If the modulo (value % divisor) is 0, the job will fail.
                                For example, if param('divisor')==5, jobs with 5, 10, 15, 20, 25,... param('value') will fail.

        param('state'):         defines the state in which the jobs of this analysis may be failing.

        param('lethal_after'):  makes jobs' failures lethal when 'value' is greater than this parameter

        param('time_FETCH_INPUT'):  time in seconds that the job will spend sleeping in FETCH_INPUT state.

        param('time_RUN'):          time in seconds that the job will spend sleeping in RUN state.

        param('time_WRITE_OUTPUT'): time in seconds that the job will spend sleeping in WRITE_OUTPUT state.

    Description : Implements param_defaults() interface method of Bio::EnsEMBL::Hive::Process that defines module defaults for parameters.

=head2 pre_cleanup

    Title   :  pre_cleanup
    Function:  sublcass can implement functions related to cleaning up the database/filesystem after the previous unsuccessful run.
                Here we just define it to see when the job gets into this state.

=head2 fetch_input

    Description : Implements fetch_input() interface method of Bio::EnsEMBL::Hive::Process that is used to read in parameters and load data.
                  Here it only calls dangerous_math() subroutine.

=head2 run

    Description : Implements run() interface method of Bio::EnsEMBL::Hive::Process that is used to perform the main bulk of the job (minus input and output).
                  Here it only calls dangerous_math() subroutine.
