=head1 DESCRIPTION

    Meadow is an abstract interface to the queue manager.

    A Meadow knows how to check&change the actual status of Workers on the farm.

=head2 new

    Title   :  new (constructor)
    Function:  Instantiates a new Meadow object

=cut

sub new {
    my ($class, $config) = @_;

    my $self = bless {}, $class;

    $self->config( $config );
    $self->context( [ 'Meadow', $self->type, $self->cached_name ] );

    return $self;
}


=head2 cached_name

    Title   :  cached_name
    Function:  Wrapper around L<name()> that caches its return value.
               This is because (1) it can be expensive to get the name
               (e.g. calling an external command), and (2) the name of a
               Meadow is not expected to change through the life of the
               agent.

=cut

sub cached_name {
    my ($self) = @_;

    my $name;

    unless( ref($self) and $name = $self->{'_name'} ) {

        }
    }

    return $name;
}


=head2 type

    Title   :  type
    Function:  The "type" of a Meadow is basically its job management
               system. eHive comes with two Meadows: Platform LSF (type
               "LSF"), and a default fork()-based (type "LOCAL"). Other
               meadows can be implemented provided that they follow the
               right interface.

=cut

sub type {
    my $class = shift @_;

    $class = ref($class) if(ref($class));

    return (reverse split(/::/, $class ))[0];
}


=head2 signature

    Title   :  signature
    Function:  The "signature" of a Meadow is its unique identifier across
               the Valley.

=cut

sub signature {
    my $self = shift @_;

    return $self->type.'/'.$self->cached_name;
}

=head2 pipeline_name

    Title   :  pipeline_name
    Function:  Getter/setter for the name of the current pipeline.
               This method is used by other Meadow methods such as
               L<job_name_prefix()>.

=cut


sub pipeline_name {
    my $self = shift @_;

    if(@_) { # new value is being set (which can be undef)
        $self->{'_pipeline_name'} = shift @_;
    }
    return $self->{'_pipeline_name'};
}


=head2 job_name_prefix

    Title   :  job_name_prefix
    Function:  Tells how the agents (workers) should be generally named. It
               is used to name new agents, and to find our own agents.

=cut

sub job_name_prefix {
    my $self = shift @_;

    return ($self->pipeline_name() ? $self->pipeline_name().'-' : '') . 'Hive-';
}


=head2 job_array_common_name

    Title   :  job_array_common_name
    Function:  More specific version of L<job_name_prefix()> that returns
               the actual name that agents should have at a specific
               beekeeper loop.

=cut

sub job_array_common_name {
    my ($self, $rc_name, $iteration) = @_;

    return $self->job_name_prefix() ."${rc_name}-${iteration}";

=head2 get_current_worker_process_id

    Title   :  get_current_worker_process_id
    Function:  Called by a worker to find its process_id. At any point in
               time, the triple (meadow_type, meadow_name, process_id)
               should be unique

=head2 status_of_all_our_workers

    Title   :  status_of_all_our_workers
    Function:  Returns an arrayref of arrayrefs [worker_pid, meadow_user, status, rc_name]
               listing the workers that this Meadow can see.
               Allowed statuses are "RUN", "PEND", "SSUSP", "UNKWN"

    Title   :  parse_report_source_line
    Function:  Opens and parses a file / command-line to return the
               resource-usage of some workers. Should return a hashref
               where process_id is the key to a hashref composed of:
