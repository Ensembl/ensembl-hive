=head1 NAME

    Bio::EnsEMBL::Hive::PipeConfig::FailureTest_conf

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    init_pipeline.pl Bio::EnsEMBL::Hive::PipeConfig::FailureTest_conf -password <your_password>

    init_pipeline.pl FailureTest_conf.pm -host=localhost -password <your_password> -job_count 100 -failure_rate 3

=head1 DESCRIPTION

    This is an example pipeline built around FailureTest.pm RunnableDB. It consists of two analyses:

    Analysis_1: JobFactory.pm is used to create an array of jobs -

        these jobs are sent down the branch #2 into the second analysis

    Analysis_2: FailureTest.pm either succeeds or dies, depending on the parameters.

=head2 default_options

    Description : Implements default_options() interface method of Bio::EnsEMBL::Hive::PipeConfig::HiveGeneric_conf that is used to initialize default options.
                  In addition to the standard things it defines three options:
                    o('job_count')          controls the total number of FailureTest jobs
                    o('failure_rate')       controls the rate of jobs that are programmed to fail
                    o('state')              controls the state in which the jobs will be failing
                    o('lethal_after')       when job_number is above this (nonzero) threshold, job's death becomes lethal to the Worker

                  There is a rule dependent on one option that does not have a default (this makes it mandatory):
                    o('password')           your read-write password for creation and maintenance of the hive database

=head2 pipeline_analyses

    Description : Implements pipeline_analyses() interface method of Bio::EnsEMBL::Hive::PipeConfig::HiveGeneric_conf that defines the structure of the pipeline: analyses, jobs, rules, etc.
                  Here it defines two analyses:

                    * 'generate_jobs'       generates a list of jobs

                    * 'failure_test'        either succeeds or fails, depending on parameters

    my ($self) = @_;

                'column_names' => [ 'value' ],
            },
            -input_ids => [
                { 'job_count'    => $self->o('job_count') },

            },
