=head1 NAME

    Bio::EnsEMBL::Hive::DBSQL::NakedTableAdaptor

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    my $intermediate_result_nt_adaptor  = $dba->get_NakedTableAdaptor( 'table_name' => 'intermediate_result' );
    my $final_result_nt_adaptor         = $final_result_nt->adaptor;

=head1 DESCRIPTION

    This module together with its data container are used to enable dataflow into arbitrary tables (rather than just 'job' table).
    Due to the implementation of EnsEMBL Registry code, NakedTable objects know *where* to dataflow, and NakedTableAdaptor knows *how* to dataflow.
