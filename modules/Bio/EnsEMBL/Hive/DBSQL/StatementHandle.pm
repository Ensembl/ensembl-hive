=head1 NAME

    Bio::EnsEMBL::Hive::DBSQL::StatementHandle

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    Do not use this class directly.
    It will automatically be used by the Bio::EnsEMBL::Hive::DBSQL::DBConnection class.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

    This class extends DBD::mysql::st so that the DESTROY method may be
    overridden.  If the DBConnection::disconnect_when_inactive flag is set
    this statement handle will cause the database connection to be closed
    when it goes out of scope and there are no other open statement handles.
