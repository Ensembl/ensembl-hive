=head1 NAME

    Bio::EnsEMBL::Hive::Utils::RedirectStack

=head1 DESCRIPTION

    Sometimes there is a need to intercept STDOUT/STDERR and log it in multiple files,
    depending on which of the nested objects is "in control" at the moment.

    In Hive when a Worker is running a job it logs into a job's file, but between jobs it logs into its own file.
    This class implements a convenient stack of proxy file descriptors that lets you log STDOUT or STDERR in various files.

=head1 USAGE EXAMPLE

    use RedirectStack;

    my $rs_stdout = RedirectStack->new(\*STDOUT);

    print "Message 1\n";            # gets displayed on the screen

    $rs_stdout->push('foo');

        print "Message 2\n";            # goes to 'foo'

        $rs_stdout->push('bar');

            print "Message 3\n";            # goes to 'bar'

            system('echo subprocess A');    # it works for subprocesses too

            $rs_stdout->pop;

        print "Message 4\n";            # goes to 'foo'

        system('echo subprocess B');    # again, works for subprocesses as well

        $rs_stdout->push('baz');

            print "Message 5\n";            # goest to 'baz'

            $rs_stdout->pop;

        print "Message 6\n";            # goes to 'foo'

        $rs_stdout->pop;

    print "Message 7\n";            # gets displayed on the screen
