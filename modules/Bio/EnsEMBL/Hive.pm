    Bio::EnsEMBL::Hive

=head1 DESCRIPTION

  Object which encapsulates the details of how to find jobs, how to run those
  jobs, and then check the rules to create the next jobs in the chain.
  Essentially knows where to find data, how to process data, and where to
  put it when it's done (put in next person's INBOX) so the next Worker
  in the chain can find data to work on.

  Hive based processing is a concept based on a more controlled version
  of an autonomous agent type system.  Each worker is not told what to do
  (like a centralized control system - like the current pipeline system)
  but rather queries a central database for jobs (give me jobs).

  Each worker is linked to an analysis_id, registers its self on creation
  into the Hive, creates a RunnableDB instance of the Analysis->module,
  gets relevant configuration information from the database, does its
  work, creates the next layer of job entries by interfacing to
  the DataflowRuleAdaptor to determine the analyses it needs to pass its
  output data to and creates jobs on the database of the next analysis.
  It repeats this cycle until it has lived its lifetime or until there are no
  more jobs left to process.
  The lifetime limit is a safety limit to prevent these from 'infecting'
  a system and sitting on a compute node for longer than is socially exceptable.
  This is primarily needed on compute resources like an LSF system where jobs
  are not preempted and run until they are done.

  The Queen's primary job is to create Workers to get the work down.
  As part of this, she is also responsible for summarizing the status of the
  analyses by querying the jobs, summarizing, and updating the
  analysis_stats table.  From this she is also responsible for monitoring and
  'unblocking' analyses via the analysis_ctrl_rules.
  The Queen is also responsible for freeing up jobs that were claimed by Workers
  that died unexpectantly so that other workers can take over the work.  

  The Beekeeper is in charge of interfacing between the Queen and a compute resource
  or 'compute farm'.  Its job is to query Queens if they need any workers and to
  send the requested number of workers to open machines via the runWorker.pl script.
  It is also responsible for interfacing with the Queen to identify workers which died
  unexpectantly so that she can free the dead workers unfinished jobs.
