=head1 NAME

    TestRunnable::TransactDummy

=head1 DESCRIPTION

    A job of 'TestRunnable::TransactDummy' analysis does not do any work,
    but it sleeps some macroscopic amount of time within a relatively long transaction
    that also performs critical semaphore_count updates.

    We use this TestRunnable within OverloadTest_conf pipeline to study the effects
    of transactional deadlocks and develop a better solution against them.
