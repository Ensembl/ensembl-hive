-- show hive progress for analyses (turned into a view to give extra flexibility) ----------------
--
-- Thanks to Greg Jordan for the idea and the original version
--
-- Usage:
--       select * from progress;                                         # the whole table (may take ages to generate, depending on the size of your pipeline)
--       select * from progress where logic_name like 'family_blast%';   # only show family_blast-related analyses
--       select * from progress where retry_count>1;                     # only show jobs that have been tried more than once

CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW progress AS
    SELECT a.logic_name || '(' || a.analysis_id || ')' analysis_name_and_id,
        MIN(rc.name) resource_class,
        j.status,
        j.retry_count,
        CASE WHEN j.status IS NULL THEN 0 ELSE count(*) END cnt,
        MIN(job_id) example_job_id
    FROM        analysis_base a
    LEFT JOIN   job j USING (analysis_id)
    LEFT JOIN   resource_class rc ON (a.resource_class_id=rc.resource_class_id)
    GROUP BY a.analysis_id, j.status, j.retry_count
    ORDER BY a.analysis_id, j.status;


-- a convenient view that also incorporates (otherwise redundant) analysis_id and logic_name ------------
--
-- Usage:
--       select * from msg;
--       select * from msg where analysis_id=18;
--       select * from msg where logic_name like 'family_blast%';

CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW msg AS
    SELECT a.analysis_id, a.logic_name, m.*
    FROM log_message m
    LEFT JOIN role USING (role_id)
    LEFT JOIN analysis_base a USING (analysis_id);


-- show statistics of Workers' real resource usage by analysis -------------------------------------------
--
-- Usage:
--       select * from resource_usage_stats;
--       select * from resource_usage_stats where logic_name like 'family_blast%';

CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW resource_usage_stats AS
    SELECT a.logic_name || '(' || a.analysis_id || ')' analysis,
           w.meadow_type,
           rc.name || '(' || rc.resource_class_id || ')' resource_class,

    GROUP BY a.analysis_id, w.meadow_type, rc.resource_class_id, u.exit_status
    ORDER BY a.analysis_id, w.meadow_type, rc.resource_class_id, u.exit_status;


-- show the roles that are currently live (grouped by meadow_users, resource_classes and analyses) -------
--
-- Usage:
--       select * from live_roles;
--       select * from live_roles where resource_class_id=12;

CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW live_roles AS
    SELECT w.meadow_user, w.meadow_type, w.resource_class_id, rc.name resource_class_name, r.analysis_id, a.logic_name, count(*)

    GROUP BY w.meadow_user, w.meadow_type, w.resource_class_id, rc.name, r.analysis_id, a.logic_name;

-- show activity of beekeepers in this hive
--
-- Usage:
--       select * from beekeeper_activity;
--
--       -- Find beekeepers that may have disappeared
--       select * from beekeeper_activity
--       where cause_of_death is null
--       and is_overdue;

CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW beekeeper_activity AS
    SELECT b.beekeeper_id, b.meadow_user, b.meadow_host, b.sleep_minutes, b.loop_limit, b.is_blocked,
           b.cause_of_death, COUNT(*) AS loops_executed,

-- time an analysis or group of analyses (given by a name pattern) ----------------------------------------
--
-- Usage:
--      SELECT * FROM time_analysis();
--      SELECT * FROM time_analysis('alignment_chains%');
