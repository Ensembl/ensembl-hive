<p>eHive (EnsEMBL Hive) is a system for running computation pipelines on distributed computing resources - clusters, farms or grids.
The name &quot;Hive&quot; comes from the way pipelines are processed by a swarm of autonomous agents.</p>

<p>eHive was originally conceived and used within EnsEMBL Compara group for running Comparative Genomics pipelines, but since then it has been separated into a separate software tool and is used in many projects both in Genome Campus, Cambridge and outside.
There is  <a href="http://listserver.ebi.ac.uk/mailman/listinfo/ehive-users">eHive users' mailing list</a> for questions, suggestions, discussions and announcements.</p>
