Semaphore independent from the autoflow
--
The autoflow event is a convenient way of grouping all the jobs created, but semaphore
groups can be created in arbitrary manners.

Here, the Dataflow events on branch #3 are iteratively grouped together (in a group named **A**)
until a Dataflow event is produced on branch #2. This will create *one* semaphore group.

Then, eHive will keep on grouping the following Dataflow events on branch #3 until there is
another Dataflow event on branch #2, which will create *another* semaphore group.

The process is repeated until exhaustion of all Dataflow events. This requires the analysis A to
emit the events in the right order. There are as many semaphore groups as events on branch #2,
each job created on branch #2 is the *funnel* of 0, 1 or many jobs of the *fan* that is defined
on branch #3.
