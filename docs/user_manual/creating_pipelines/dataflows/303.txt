Factory with a funnel
--
Dataflow events can be grouped with the ``->`` operator.

``2->A`` means that all the Dataflow events on branch #2 have to be grouped together
in a group named **A**. Note that this name **A** is not related to the name of the
analysis. Group names are single-letter codes, meaning that eHive allows up to 26 groups
for each analysis.

``A->1`` means that the job resulting from the Dataflow event on branch #1 (the _autoflow_)
has to wait for *all* the jobs in group **A** before it can start.

This pattern is called a _semaphore_, and C is called the _funnel_ analysis.
