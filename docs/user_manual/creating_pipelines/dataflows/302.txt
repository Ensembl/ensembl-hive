Factory in parallel of the autoflow
--
In the above example, nothing was connected to the branch #1 of analysis A. The default *autoflow* event
was thus lost.

An analysis can use multiple branches at the same time and for instance produce a fan of jobs on branch #2
*and* still a job on branch #1. Both stream of jobs (B and C) are executed in parallel.

{   -logic_name => 'A',
    -flow_into  => {
       2 => [ 'B' ],
       1 => [ 'C' ],
    },
},
{   -logic_name => 'B',
},
{   -logic_name => 'C',
},
