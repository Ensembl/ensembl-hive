Factory with a funnel
--

Jobs created by a job that is part of a semaphore group are
automatically added to the semaphore group.

In the example below, the job in C (the _funnel_) will have to
wait for all its controlling jobs in B to complete, but also all
the jobs these may have created in D as well.

This process is called _semaphore propagation_ .

{   -logic_name => 'A',
    -flow_into  => {
       '2->A' => [ 'B' ],
       'A->1' => [ 'C' ],
    },
},
{   -logic_name => 'B',
    -flow_into  => {
       2 => [ 'D' ],
    },
},
{   -logic_name => 'C',
},
{   -logic_name => 'D',
},
