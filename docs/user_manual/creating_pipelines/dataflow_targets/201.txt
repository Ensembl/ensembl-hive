Dataflow to one analysis
--
This is what we have used in the Dataflow document. Simply name the target analysis after the ``=>``
with a URL that contains the ``table_name`` key. URLs can be *degenerate*, i.e. skip the part before
the question mark (like below) or *completely defined*, i.e. start with ``driver://user@host/database_name``.

{   -logic_name => 'A',
    -flow_into  => {
       1 => [ '?table_name=B' ],
    },
},
