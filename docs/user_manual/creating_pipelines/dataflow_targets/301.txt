Single accumulator
--
An accumulator is defined with a special URL that contains the ``accu_name`` key. There are five types
of accumulators (scalar, pile, multiset, array and hash), all described in :doc:`accumulators`.

Accumulators can **only** be connected to *fan* analyses of a semaphore group. All the data flown into them
is *accumulated* and passed on to the *funnel* once the latter is released.

{   -logic_name => 'A',
    -flow_into  => {
       '2->A' => [ 'B' ],
       'A->1' => [ 'D' ],
    },
},
{   -logic_name => 'B',
    -flow_into  => {
       1 => [ '?accu_name=pile_accu&accu_input_variable=variable_name&accu_address=[]' ],
    },
},
{   -logic_name => 'D',
},
