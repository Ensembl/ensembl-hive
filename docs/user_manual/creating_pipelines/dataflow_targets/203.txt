Multiple dataflows to tables and analyses
--
An analysis can dataflow to multiple targets, both of analysis and table types.

Rows inserted by table-dataflows are usually not linked to the emitting job_id.
In the example below, a row from the table C will typically not have information
about the analysis (job) that generated it.
This can however be enabled by explicitly adding the job_id to the dataflow payload.

{   -logic_name => 'A',
    -flow_into  => {
       2 => [ 'B', '?table_name=C' ],
       1 => [ 'D' ],
    },
},
{   -logic_name => 'B',
},
{   -logic_name => 'D',
    -flow_into  => {
       3 => [ '?table_name=C' ],
    },
},
