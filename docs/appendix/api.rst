API Documentation
=================

The API documentation is automatically generated with `Doxygen
<http://www.doxygen.org/>`__ (and a custom Perl filter provided by `Ensembl
<https://github.com/Ensembl/ensembl/tree/HEAD/misc-scripts/doxygen_filter>`__)
from the annotations and comments added to the source-code.
