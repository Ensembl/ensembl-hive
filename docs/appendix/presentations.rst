.. Trick: the images have to be available at compilation time and can't
   have whitespace in their names. The paths must thus be valid from the
   current directory. However, the targets are not copied over by default.
   They are only copied over by adding them to html_extra_dir, which
   changes the path.

The workshop was composed of four parts

1. Introduction to eHive

   This part gives an overview of eHive, and explains the basic concepts
   of workflow management.

2. Initializing and running eHive pipelines

   This part shows how to run already-existing pipelines.

4. Writing your own runnable modules

   This part is about writing new components (runnables) to add to
   pipelines.
