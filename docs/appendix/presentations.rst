Presentations & Workshop materials
----------------------------------

We occasionally run workshops to teach how to use eHive, at the EMBL-EBI
and in other institutes too.  If you are interested in hosting, please
contact the Ensembl Helpdesk (http://www.ensembl.org/Help/Contact).

March 2017, Roslin Institute

.. Trick: the images have to be available at compilation time and can't
   have whitespace in their names. The paths must thus be valid from the
   current directory. However, the targets are not copied over by default.
   They are only copied over by adding them to html_extra_dir, which
   changes the path.

In 2017 we ran two workshops consecutively: at the NCHC, Hsinchu, Taiwan,
and at the Roslin Institute, Edinburgh, United Kingdom. Here are the
materials we used at the latter. The workshop was composed of four parts:

1. Introduction to eHive

   This part gives an overview of eHive, and explains the basic concepts
   of workflow management.

2. Initialising and running eHive pipelines

   This part shows how to run already-existing pipelines.

3. Pipeline configuration

   This part is about writing new pipelines using available components.

4. Writing your own runnable modules

   This part is about writing new components (runnables) to add to
   pipelines.
