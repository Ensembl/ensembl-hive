Runnables Included in the eHive Distribution
============================================

Several Runnables are included in the standard eHive distribution, serving as something like a standard library of components that are commonly helpful when creating pipelines. All of these are located in the directory modules/Bio/EnsEMBL/Hive/RunnableDB/. In addition, there are Runnables included with the examples under modules/Bio/EnsEMBL/Hive/Examples/. Although those are written to fit into specific example pipelines to illustrate specific eHive concepts, some users may find them useful in their own pipelines.

The included examples are:

   - :doxehive:`Bio::EnsEMBL::Hive::RunnableDB::DatabaseDumper`
   - :doxehive:`Bio::EnsEMBL::Hive::RunnableDB::DbCmd`
   - :doxehive:`Bio::EnsEMBL::Hive::RunnableDB::Dummy`
   - :doxehive:`Bio::EnsEMBL::Hive::RunnableDB::FastaFactory`
   - :doxehive:`Bio::EnsEMBL::Hive::RunnableDB::JobFactory`
   - :doxehive:`Bio::EnsEMBL::Hive::RunnableDB::MySQLTransfer`
   - :doxehive:`Bio::EnsEMBL::Hive::RunnableDB::NotifyByEmail`
   - :doxehive:`Bio::EnsEMBL::Hive::RunnableDB::SlackNotification`
   - :doxehive:`Bio::EnsEMBL::Hive::RunnableDB::SqlCmd`
   - :doxehive:`Bio::EnsEMBL::Hive::RunnableDB::SqlHealthcheck`
   - :doxehive:`Bio::EnsEMBL::Hive::RunnableDB::SystemCmd`
