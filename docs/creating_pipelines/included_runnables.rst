Standard library of Runnables
=============================

Several Runnables are included in the standard eHive distribution,
providing a library of components that can be helpful when creating
pipelines. All of these are located in the directory
modules/Bio/EnsEMBL/Hive/RunnableDB/. In addition, there are Runnables
included with the examples under
modules/Bio/EnsEMBL/Hive/Examples/. Although those are written to fit into
specific example pipelines to illustrate specific eHive concepts, you may
find them useful in your own pipelines.

The included examples are:

   - :doxehive:`Bio::EnsEMBL::Hive::RunnableDB::DatabaseDumper`
   - :doxehive:`Bio::EnsEMBL::Hive::RunnableDB::DbCmd`
   - :doxehive:`Bio::EnsEMBL::Hive::RunnableDB::Dummy`
   - :doxehive:`Bio::EnsEMBL::Hive::RunnableDB::FastaFactory`
   - :doxehive:`Bio::EnsEMBL::Hive::RunnableDB::JobFactory`
   - :doxehive:`Bio::EnsEMBL::Hive::RunnableDB::MySQLTransfer`
   - :doxehive:`Bio::EnsEMBL::Hive::RunnableDB::NotifyByEmail`
   - :doxehive:`Bio::EnsEMBL::Hive::RunnableDB::SlackNotification`
   - :doxehive:`Bio::EnsEMBL::Hive::RunnableDB::SqlCmd`
   - :doxehive:`Bio::EnsEMBL::Hive::RunnableDB::SqlHealthcheck`
   - :doxehive:`Bio::EnsEMBL::Hive::RunnableDB::SystemCmd`
