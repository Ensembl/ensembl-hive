<li><h3>This is a walkthrough of a simple 3-analysis example pipeline.</h3>
    <p>
        The goal of the pipeline is to multiply two long numbers.
        We pretend that it cannot be done in one operation on a single machine.
        So we decide to split the task into subtasks of multiplying the first long number
        by individual digits of the second long number for the sake of an example.
        At the last step the partial products are shifted and added together to yield the final product.
    </p>
    <br/>
    <br/>
    <center>
        We demonstrate what happens in the pipeline with the help of two types of diagrams:
        job-level dependency (J-)diagrams and analysis-rule (A-)diagrams:
    </center>

    <table border=0 cellpadding=10>
    <tr>
        <td>
            <p>
                A <b>J-diagram</b> is a directed acyclic graph where nodes represent Jobs, Semaphores or Accumulators
                with edges representing relationships and dependencies. Most of these objects are created dynamically
                during the pipeline execution, so here you'll see a lot of action - the J-diagram will be growing.
            </p>
            <p><i>
                J-diagrams can be generated at any moment during a pipeline's execution by running Hive's <b>visualize_jobs.pl</b> script (new in version/2.5) .
            </i></p>

        <td>
            <p>
                An <b>A-diagram</b> is a directed graph where most of the nodes represent Analyses and edges represent Rules.
                As a whole it represents the structure of the pipeline which is normally static.
                The only changing elements will be job counts and analysis colours.
            </p>
            <p><i>

        The main bulk of this document is a commented series of snapshots of both types of diagrams during the execution of the pipeline.
    <br/>
        They can be approximately reproduced by running a sequence of commands, similar to these, in a terminal:

                The J-diagram shows a couple of 3d-boxes, they represent specific Jobs.
                Each Job is an individual task that can be run on an individual machine.
                We need at least one initial Job to run a pipeline. However that one Job
                may generate many more as it gets executed.
            </p>
            <p>
                In this example we have two initial Jobs. They were created automatically during the pipeline's initialization process.
                These two initial Jobs will generate two independent "streams" of execution which will yield their own independent results.
                Since in this particular pipeline we are simply multiplying same two numbers in different orders, we expect the final results to be identical.
            </p>
        </td>
        <td>
            <p>
                The A-diagram shows how execution of the pipeline is guided by Rules.
                Since the Rules are mostly static, the diagram will also be changing very little.
            </p>
            <p>
                The main objects on A-diagram are rectangles with rounded corners, they represent Analyses.
                Analyses are "types" of Jobs (Analyses broadly define which code to run, where and how,
                but miss specific parameters which become defined in Jobs).
                In this pipeline we have three types: 'take_b_apart', 'part_multiply' and 'add_together'.
            </p>
            <p>
                The "take_b_apart" Analysis contains two Jobs, which are in 'READY' state (can be checked-out for execution).
                Our colour for 'READY' is green, so both the Analysis and the specific Jobs are shown in green.

                Job_1 has finished running and is now in 'DONE' state (colour-coded blue).
                It has generated 6 more Jobs: five in Analysis 'part_multiply' (splitting its own task into parts)
                and one in Analysis 'add_together' (which will recombine the results of the former into the final result).
            </p>
            <p>
                The newly created 'part_multiply' Jobs also control a Semaphore which blocks the 'add_together' Job
                which is in 'SEMAPHORED' state and cannot be executed yet (grey).
                The Semaphore is essentially a counter that gets decremented each time one of the controlling Jobs becomes 'DONE'.
                It is our primary mechanism for synchronization of control- and dataflow.
