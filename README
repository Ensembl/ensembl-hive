Summary:
    Ensembl Hive is a distributed processing system based on 'autonomous agents' and
    Hive behavioural structure of Honey Bees. It implements all functionality of both
    data-flow graphs and block-branch diagrams which should allow it to codify
    any program, algorithm, or parallel processing job control system.
    It is not bound to any processing 'farm' system and can be adapted to any GRID.
