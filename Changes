 Release 2.7.0
 - New support for Slurm through the SLURM meadow.
 - The option CleanupTempDirectoryKilledWorkers did not work on Slurm. For that
   meadow, it is now a no-op.
 - The Java guest language was removed since it has not been used.
 
 Deprecations:
 - All meadows except Slurm and Local are now deprecated. This applies to the
   built-in LSF and the meadows hosted by EnsEMBL in these repositories:
   - ensembl-hive-htcondor
   - ensembl-hive-sge
   - ensembl-hive-pbspro
   - ensembl-hive-docker-swarm
   Please contact us if you are still using any of these.
