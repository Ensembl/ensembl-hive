2.7   2024-09-XX

 Release 2.7
 - New support for Slurm through the SLURM meadow.
 - The option CleanupTempDirectoryKilledWorkers did not work on Slurm. For that
   meadow, it is now a no-op.
 - The Java guest language was removed since it has not been used.
 
 Deprecations:
 - All meadows except Slurm and Local are now deprecated. We can not currently
   test on these systems, therefore we can not support them.
